## History
Programming Language: *Coq*

Coq is a proof assistant first released in 1989. It initially used Thierry Coquand's type theory called Calculus of Constructions, but later implementation used an improved framework named Calculus of Inductive Constructions. Coq is generally attributed to Thierry Coquand, GÃ©rard Huet and Christine Paulin-Mohring. To give a proper explanation of Coq's inner working, we would have to go into the rabbit hole of Lambda Calculus and Lambda Expression, Type Theory, First-Order, Higher-Order Logic and many more. I have discovered a truly marvelous explanation for these concepts, which however the margin of this README.md is not large enough to contain. As such, readers are expected to consult the links below and come to that understanding themselves.

But to explain in layman's terms, proof assistants in general and Coq in particular were developed for one main purpose: To formalize mathematics. To simplify even further: Given a proof of a (mathematical) problem, can we verify the correctness of its argument with absolute certainty? This dream of mathematic formalization can be traced back to Hilbert's program, and *Principia Mathematica* by Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead.
